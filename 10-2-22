Objects and Object Constructors (JavaScript)

object literal syntax is as follows:

const myObject = {
  property: 'Value!',
  otherProperty: 77,
  "obnoxious property": function() {
    // do stuff!
 }
}

There are also 2 ways to get information out of an object: dot notation and bracket notation.

// dot notation
myObject.property // 'Value!'

// bracket notation
myObject["obnoxious property"] // [Function]

Dot notation is easier and cleaner but depends on context. It's great for personal preference but it doesn't always work (it depends on context of what
you're working with):

For example, myObject."obnoxious property" wonâ€™t work because that property is a string with a space in it; likewise, you cannot use variables in dot notation:

const variable = 'property'

myObject.variable // this gives us 'undefined' because it's looking for a property named 'variable' in our object

myObject[variable] // this is equivalent to myObject['property'] and returns 'Value!'

You can begin to organize your code is by simply grouping things into objects, like this (a tic-tac-toe game):

// example one
const playerOneName = "tim"
const playerTwoName = "jenn"
const playerOneMarker = "X"
const playerTwoMarker = "O"

// example two
const playerOne = {
  name: "tim",
  marker: "X"
}

const playerTwo = {
  name: "jenn",
  marker: "O"
}
