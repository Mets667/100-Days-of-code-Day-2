//JavaScript with exercism.org! So exciting! :)

Right now I'm learning something from exercism.org, and I will post what I'm doing there. 

Solved my first exercise in which I had to do "Hello, World!" by using the information given:

export function hello() {
  return 'Hello, World!';
}

It was originally:

export funtion hello() {
 return 'Goodbye, Mars!';
 }
