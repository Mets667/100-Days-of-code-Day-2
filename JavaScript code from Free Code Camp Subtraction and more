Subtract One Number from Another with JavaScript

const myVar = 12 - 6;

Change the 0 so the difference is 12.

const difference = 45 - 33;
Changed the number from const difference = 45 - 0; to 33 (45 - 33 = 12);

Multiply Two Numbers with JavaScript

const myVar = 13 * 13;

myVar would have the value 169.

Change the 0 so that product will equal 80.

const product = 8 * 10;

Divide One Number by Another with JavaScript

const myVar = 16 / 2;
myVar now has the value 8.

Change the 0 so that the quotient is equal to 2.

const quotient = 66 / 0;

const quotient = 66 / 33;

Increment a Number with JavaScript

Change the code to use the ++ operator on myVar.

let myVar = 87;

// Only change code below this line
myVar = myVar + 1;

I got confused with this; I'm not gonna lie. I thought you had to change the number but I guess not. 
The answer is myVar++;

Decrement a Number with JavaScript

i--;
is the equivalent of

i = i - 1;

Change the code to use the -- operator
on myVar.

let myVar = 11;

// Only change code below this line
myVar--;

I think I'm getting this now. It looks tougher because I overthink and overshoot the message here.

Create Decimal Numbers with JavaScript

Create a variable myDecimal and give it a decimal value with a fractional part (e.g. 5.7).

const ourDecimal = 5.7;

// Only change code below this line
var myDecimal = 2.8;

I thought you would have to keep the 'our' in ourDecimal, but apparently you change it. Huh.

Multiply Two Decimals with JavaScript

Change the 0.0 so that product will equal 5.0.

const product = 2.0 * 0.0;

Here I thought you had to multiply the "2" but not... You have to change it to '5' and '1'. (You can't make '2' equal '5' so yeah.)

const product = 5.0 * 1.0;

Divide One Decimal by Another with JavaScript

Change the 0.0 so that quotient will equal to 2.2.

const quotient = 0.0 / 2.0; // Change this line

const quotient = 4.4 / 2.0;

I have to say my Math skills are HORRID. It took me FOREVER to figure this out, no lie.
